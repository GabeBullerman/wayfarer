# SorTrek — Changelog

## 2026-06 — Rebrand, dark mode, and feature wave

### Branding
- Rebrand Wayfarer → **SorTrek** across the app (title, PWA manifest, copy,
  Angular project + build paths, package name).
- New logo set (clear-on-circle / white / black), theme-aware login & register
  logos, theme-aware favicon (light/dark), per-page browser tab titles
  (`SorTrek | <Page>`).

### Dark mode & theming
- CSS design-token system (`src/styles/_tokens.scss`) — light + dark sets.
- Material dark theme + `ThemeService` (persists choice, follows OS by default).
- Animated "Within" theme toggle (desktop toolbar; sidenav menu on mobile).
- ~190 hardcoded colors migrated to tokens + dark-mode contrast passes.

### Features
- **Timezone-aware flight times** — labels each flight time with its airport
  zone (e.g. MST/CEST) when a flight crosses zones (`TimezoneService` + a
  ~140-airport dataset). Shown in Bookings, Schedule, Overview.
- **Calendar export (.ics)** — "Add to Calendar" on Overview.
- **Search/filter** on Bookings, Costs, Documents.
- **Countdown badge** on upcoming trip cards; trips sorted soonest-first.
- **Guide** — added Overview/Map, Photos, Packing, Profile pages.
- **Packing templates** — one-tap starter lists (Beach/Ski/City/Camping/Essentials).
- **Status-colored booking borders** (confirmed/pending/cancelled/suggestion).
- **Schedule propose → approve** — collaborators propose items; owners approve/
  reject; owners grant per-collaborator "can edit schedule" in the People tab.
- **Today card** on Overview when currently on the trip.
- **Multi-currency expenses** — foreign amounts convert to the trip's home
  currency for totals; native amount still shown.
- **Booking file attachments** — boarding passes / confirmations (PDF/image).
- **Read-only public itinerary link** (`/s/<token>`) — sanitized, served by an
  Admin-SDK API (no public client reads).
- **Flight check-in reminders** — daily Vercel cron sends FCM push to trip
  members (works with the app closed).

### Fixes & quality
- Find Plans now only suggests events available on the selected day
  (date-targeted search + structured dates + server-side date filter).
- Photo reliability: purge orphaned photo docs, fix broken-image flicker,
  correct the visible count.
- Bundle: `@defer` all 10 trip-detail tabs (chunk 488 kB → 15 kB; per-tab
  on-demand loading).
- Firestore `ignoreUndefinedProperties` (prevents undefined-field save hangs).
- Storage rule: cover-photo read now requires sign-in.
- Mobile: responsive pass across the app; theme toggle in sidenav; guide
  illustrations fit (aspect-ratio); "Bookings at a Glance" reflow; map
  re-fits to pins under lazy-loaded tabs.
- Accessibility: aria-labels / alt text across high-traffic screens.

### Deploy/setup notes
- Admin-backed features (public link, push cron) need `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
  and `CRON_SECRET` in Vercel env.
- Security rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage`.
